    <li>Beef fillet (4 fillets of 250 g) 1 kg</li>
    <li>Garlic 2 cloves</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil to taste</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Mixed peppercorns 4 seasons to taste</li>
    <p><strong>FOR THE PUMPKIN CREAM</strong></p>
    <li>Neapolitan pumpkin (to be cleaned) 400 g</li>
    <li>Shallot 2</li>
    <li>Water 100g</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil to taste</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Mixed peppercorns 4 seasons to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To prepare the peppered beef fillet with pumpkin cream, first start tying the fillets with string.</li>
    <li>Now season the fillets on both sides with the salt and the pepper mix.</li>
    <li>Place in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave at room temperature just long enough to prepare the rest.</li>
    <li>Now clean the pumpkin and cut it into small cubes, the smaller they are the less time it will take to cook the pumpkin.</li>
    <li>Finely chop the shallot. In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the shallot and stew over low heat for about 2-3 minutes. Pour the pumpkin cut into cubes.</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper. Mix and pour 100 g of water, then cover with a lid and cook for about 15 minutes over medium heat.</li>
    <li>The pumpkin should be soft. Once ready, place it in a tall jug and blend it with the immersion blender.</li>
    <li>You should obtain a smooth cream. Heat a non-stick pan on the heat with 2 cloves of garlic and a drizzle of oil, lay the fillets.</li>
    <li>After 7-8 minutes, turn the fillets for medium cooking; the time depends on the thickness of the meat. Now let the other side cook for 7-8 minutes. Transfer the fillet to a wire rack and let it rest here for another 7-8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide the fillet in half, pour the pumpkin cream onto the plate, flavor the cream with the pepper mix and place the meat on top. The spiced beef fillet with pumpkin cream is ready to be enjoyed.</li>
