  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To make Bolognese ragù, first prepare the vegetable/meat broth.</li>
    <li>Move on to the bacon: cut it first into slices and then into strips, without being too precise. Then, using a knife or a crescent cutter, chop it well .</li>
    <li>Pour a drizzle of oil into an already hot saucepan and add the pork belly.</li>
    <li>Grain it well and let it brown.</li>
    <li>In the meantime, take care of the vegetables. Peel the carrot and chop it finely . Then clean the celery and chop it to the same size too.</li>
    <li>Finally, peel the onion and chop it.</li>
    <li>As soon as the bacon is well browned, add the chopped vegetables.</li>
    <li>Mix and leave to simmer for 5-6 minutes. Add the minced beef pulp to the sauté.</li>
    <li>Mix and raise the heat. Let it brown without haste, the meat should seal well.</li>
    <li>Add the red wine and mix again. As soon as the alcohol has evaporated, add the tomato puree.</li>
    <li>Stir to incorporate it. Add a couple of ladles of hot vegetable broth.</li>
    <li>Cover with the lid, but without closing completely. At this point the ragù should cook for at least 2 hours. Check it every 20 minutes and add more broth as needed. After 2 hours, taste the ragù, season with salt and pepper. Mix and your ragù will be ready.</li>
