  <h1>Milanese cotoletta</h1>
  <img src="../images/cotoletta.jpg" alt="Unlucky that you cannot admire this delicacy">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Unlike the Viennese, made with pork, the Milanese cutlet is prepared with tender veal which has a more delicate flavour.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Rack of veal 1 kg</li>
    <li>Large eggs 4</li>
    <li>Breadcrumbs 300 g</li>
    <li>Clarified butter 300 g</li>
    <li>Maldon salt to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To prepare the Milanese cutlet, first cut the cutlets from the rack of veal. To do this, cut the meat by sliding the knife between one bone and the other so as to obtain 4 cutlets weighing approximately 250 g each.</li>
    <li>At this point, scrape the bone with the tip of a knife, so as to completely clean it of the skin, which would otherwise become dark during cooking, so instead the hot butter will make the handle of the bone light.</li>
    <li>Still using the knife, reduce the portion of the bone, eliminating part of it, in order to have more immediate cooking. Using a meat mallet, lightly beat the meat, just so as to uniform the thickness but without reducing it. Using the knife again eliminate the superfluous ribs, which would cause the cutlet to shrink during cooking.</li>
    <li>Keep the meat aside and deal with the eggs. Break them into a bowl and beat them with a whisk, without breaking them too much. If they are small, add another.</li>
    <li>Instead, transfer the breadcrumbs into a large bowl. Taking the ribs off the bone, make a first pass in the breadcrumbs,then dip them in the egg and again in the breadcrumbs, pressing well with your hands so that the breading adheres as best as possible.</li>
    <li>Again in the breadcrumbs, pressing well but without flattening the meat too much. Repeat this operation for all the ribs, then using the blade of the flat knife, beat the slices to uniform and fix the breading</li>
    <li>Finally, with the non-cutting part, draw a sort of grid on the ribs, first making horizontal lines and then vertical.</li>
    <li>Repeat the same thing for all the others.</li>
    <li>As soon as it is hot but not hot, place the ribs, making sure that the scored part is in contact with the pan.After about 4 minutes, the chops will be nicely browned, so turn them over.</li>
    <li>With collect a little cooking fat with a spoon and sprinkle it on the rib bone; in this way there will be no blood streaks but you will obtain a clear bone. The cutlets will have to cook for about another 4 minutes, this time depends in any case on the thickness and you will have to obtain a pink meat inside.</li>
    <li>The chops are ready, using tongs, always transfer them to a plate with absorbent paper and always gently dab them with a sheet of paper, to eliminate excess fat.</li>
    <li>At this point everything is ready, all you have to do is plate it.Season it with Maldon salt. Serve your Milanese cutlet piping hot.</li>
